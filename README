cado (can do) is a project management software
-----------

I needed something self-hosted and deeply simple to manage my work/personal projects. 
And I will add features at my own pace. The only dependency is docker, but you can 
locally run with a mysql instance, or change ``db.py`` to use a simpler/different engine.

Working on adding:
* search
* tags
* groups / users


Note if you prefer a host-path volume, change the db volume to a bind mount:
```
services:
  db:
    volumes:
      - ./data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```
Then create the directory once and restart the stack:
```
mkdir -p data/mysql
```
